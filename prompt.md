# General

Hi, this is my symfony 6.4 webapp to manage my tasks, clients, reminders and so on.
Using PHP 8.2 attributes, mysql, npm & webpack, bootstrap 5.3.
It's called wuwei and it's aimed at bringing synergy in life and tasks by doing things effortlessly.
Please follow these standards and best practices to help me.

## Requirement section

Now I want to implement a requirement section, this is mainly for drafting proposals and providing estimates to Client requests.
Please feel free to ask me any questions before if needed.
The idea is to note down the Client's requirement clearly then building a task list that estimates how much time executing the tasks will take.

### Requirements requirements
* Group requirements
* Requirements need an optional Est. (hrs) value
* Requirements need an optional monetary value
* I need to link tasks to a requirement

### Requirement Details
* Name 
* Description
* Est (hrs) / Sizing
* Cost
