Wu Wei is a Symfony-based web application designed to help you cultivate wisdom, balance, and discipline in your daily
life.

## Project Description

Wu Wei is a Symfony-based web application designed to help you cultivate wisdom, balance, and discipline in your daily
life. It offers a range of features aimed at enhancing productivity and well-being. The task management aspect of Wu Wei
allows users to organize and manage their tasks efficiently, providing a structured system for categorizing tasks into
personal and professional domains. This feature is complemented by other functionalities, such as objective management,
habit building, AI integration, and notifications. By incorporating elements from different cultural methodologies, Wu
Wei allows users to schedule tasks in alignment with their energy levels and cultural considerations. The ultimate goal
is to enhance productivity, maintain work-life balance, and cultivate a sense of harmony in users' daily lives.

## Features

Wu Wei offers the following key features:

- Objective Management: Set, organize, and track your goals and objectives with ease.
- Habit Building: Cultivate positive habits and break unproductive patterns.
- AI Integration: Leverage artificial intelligence for objective research and personalized insights.
- Notifications: Stay updated with browser and email notifications.
- Chinese Clock Methodology: Correlate task completion with Chinese Zodiac periods for productivity analysis.

## How We Came Up With the Name

The name "Wu Wei" was chosen to reflect the essence of effortless action and aligning tasks with natural rhythms. In
Taoism, "Wu Wei" refers to the practice of non-doing, or taking action without force or resistance. By embracing the
concept of Wu Wei, we aim to provide users with a task management approach that emphasizes ease, flow, and harmony.

## How We Incorporated Cultural Methodologies

Wu Wei integrates concepts from different cultural methodologies to enhance task management. These methodologies
include:

- [Chinese Clock](docs/chinese-clock.md): Correlates task completion with Chinese Zodiac periods to optimize
  productivity.
- [Ayurvedic Dosha Clock](docs/Ayurvedic-Dosha-Clock.md): Considers the user's dosha type to schedule tasks in alignment
  with energy patterns.
- [Egyptian Temporal Beliefs](docs/Egyptian-Temporal-System.md): Incorporates the ancient Egyptian temporal beliefs for
  task scheduling.

### Example

- [Daily](docs/daily.md): A walk through a day based on the above concepts
- [Weekly](docs/weekly.md): A walk through the week based on the above concepts
