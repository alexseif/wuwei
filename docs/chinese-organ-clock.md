# Chinese Organ Clock / Body clock / Meridian Clock

The Chinese clock, also known as the Body Clock or Meridian Clock, is a traditional concept in Chinese medicine that
associates different organs and energetic pathways with specific times of the day. According to this system, each
two-hour period is associated with a particular organ and its corresponding energy.

The Chinese clock can be represented as follows:

| Time               | Organ           | Element | Energetic Quality |
|--------------------|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| 11:00 pm - 1:00 am | Gallbladder     | Wood    | Yin               |
