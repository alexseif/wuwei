# Chinese Organ Clock

The Chinese clock, also known as the Body Clock or Meridian Clock, is a traditional concept in Chinese medicine that
associates different organs and energetic pathways with specific times of the day. According to this system, each
two-hour period is associated with a particular organ and its corresponding energy.

The Chinese clock can be represented as follows:

| Time               | Organ           | Element | Energetic Quality |
|--------------------|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| 11:00 pm - 1:00 am | Gallbladder     | Wood    | Yin               |
| 1:00 am - 3:00 am  | Liver           | Wood    | Yin               |
| 3:00 am - 5:00 am  | Lungs           | Metal   | Yin               |
| 5:00 am - 7:00 am  | Large Intestine | Metal   | Yang              |
| 7:00 am - 9:00 am  | Stomach         | Earth   | Yang              |
| 9:00 am - 11:00 am | Spleen/Pancreas | Earth   | Yang              |
| 11:00 am - 1:00 pm | Heart           | Fire    | Yin               |
| 1:00 pm - 3:00 pm  | Small Intestine | Fire    | Yin               |
| 3:00 pm - 5:00 pm  | Bladder         | Water   | Yin               |
| 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm  | Kidneys         | Water   | Yang              |
| 7:00 pm - 9:00 pm  | Pericardium     | Fire    | Yang              |
| 9:00 pm - 11:00 pm | Triple Burner   | Fire    | Yang              |

Please note that these associations are based on traditional Chinese medicine beliefs and may have variations in
different interpretations. The Chinese clock can serve as a guide for understanding the energetic qualities of each
organ and planning activities accordingly.
