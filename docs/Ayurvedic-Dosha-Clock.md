# Ayurvedic Dosha Clock

The Ayurvedic dosha clock is a concept in Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, that associates different times of the day with the three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. According to Ayurveda, each dosha has its own energetic qualities and influences our physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

The Ayurvedic dosha clock can be represented as follows:

| Time               | Dosha    | Energetic Qualities                 |
|--------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| 2:00 am - 6:00 am  | Vata     | Creative, Active Mind, Inspiration  |
| 6:00 am - 10:00 am | Kapha    | Nurturing, Grounded, Stability      |
| 10:00 am - 2:00 pm | Pitta    | Sharp Mind, Intensity, Focus        |
| 2:00 pm - 6:00 pm  | Vata     | Socializing, Communication          |
| 6:00 pm - 10:00 pm | Kapha    | Relaxation, Digestion, Wind Down    |
| 10:00 pm - 2:00 am | Pitta    | Deep Sleep, Regeneration, Healing   |

Please note that these associations are based on Ayurvedic principles and may have variations in different interpretations. The Ayurvedic dosha clock provides a framework for understanding the energetic qualities and influences of each dosha during specific times of the day, helping individuals align their activities and routines with the natural rhythms of their body and mind.
